Have you ever grown tired of fiddling with complex tools like `awk` and `sed` to complete the simplest of tasks? Have you ever wanted to just remove the first few characters from each line of an input? Have you ever found yourself striggling to dynammically delete text inline between two patterns? Well **now you can!** `str` is the one ring to rule... most of them! The one command line tool you just can't put down!
